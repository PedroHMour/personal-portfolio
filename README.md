This repository contains the source code for my personal portfolio website. It is a fully responsive, single-page application built with modern web technologies to showcase my skills, projects, and expertise as a Python Developer, with a focus on automation and API integration.

## üöÄ Key Features

This isn't just a static page. I've implemented several key features to make it dynamic, user-friendly, and professional:

* **Fully Responsive Design**: Adapts seamlessly to all screen sizes using CSS Flexbox and Grid, providing an optimal viewing experience on desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.
* **Interactive Background**: Features a subtle and interactive particle animation using the `particles.js` library to create a modern, engaging aesthetic.
* **Multilingual Support (i18n)**: Dynamically switches the website's content between **English**, **French**, and **Portuguese** without a page reload. The user's language preference is automatically saved to their browser's `localStorage`.
* **SEO Optimized**: Enhanced with a full suite of meta tags, including Open Graph for social media (LinkedIn, etc.), Twitter Cards, and **JSON-LD Schema.org** structured data to improve search engine visibility.
* **Downloadable CV**: Includes a direct call-to-action button for visitors to download my international resume.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

This project was built from the ground up using fundamental web technologies.

* **Frontend**: HTML5, CSS3 (Variables, Flexbox, Grid, Media Queries), JavaScript (ES6+)
* **Libraries**: `particles.js` for background animation.
* **Development**: Visual Studio Code, Git & GitHub.
* **Deployment**: [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, GitHub Pages] ## üìÇ Project Structure

The project is organized with a clear and scalable file structure.
